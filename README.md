This project is to create an AI which can play Tic Tac Toe and cannot be defeated at all.

The project uses the minimax algorithm for the AI. One can learn more about the minimax algorithm from these links.

This project uses Vanilla Javascript for implementing the algorithm.

Other features of this project include playing two player game and a one player game with easy difficulty.(AI just does some random moves)
